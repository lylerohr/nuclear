# Cordial (Previously Nuclear)

### Coming soon!

A Sass and Atomic based framework that models the canonical CSS Zen Garden minimalism and separation of scope.

Name change will happen in time. Started with project Nuclear to play off of Brad Frost's Atomic, but I'll be switching to Cordial soon.

Thanks!
